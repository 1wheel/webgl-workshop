The depth buffer is a 2D array with the same dimensions as the drawing buffer that stores the distance to the camera in clip coordinates. To use the depth buffer to render objects in 3D, you first have to turn on the depth test:\n\n```javascript\ngl.enable(gl.DEPTH_TEST)\n```\n\nIf the depth test is turned on, then for each fragment that is drawn the position in the fragment (again in clip coordinates) is compared to the depth buffer value, and if it is closer then it gets rendered.\n\nAfter drawing a frame, it is necessary to clear the depth buffer. This can be done by calling `gl.clear` with the `gl.DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT` flag:\n\n```javascript\ngl.clear(gl.DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT)\n```\n\nYou can clear multiple buffers at once by combining flags together:\n\n```javascript\n//Clear color and depth buffer\ngl.clear(gl.COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | gl.DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT)\n```",
