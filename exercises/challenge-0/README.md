# First challenge: Draw a triangle

For the first challenge you should combine all the things that you have learned so far about WebGL to draw a single triangle to the screen.

The coordinates for the vertices of the triangle should be:

* `(0,1)`
* `(-1,0)`
* `(1,0)`

in normalized screen coordinates.

The triangle should be blue and the background should be yellow.

Good luck!
