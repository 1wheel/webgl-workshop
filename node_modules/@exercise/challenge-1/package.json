The vertices of the cube and the UV texture coordinates are provided for you, along with a texture that should be applied to each face.  A camera matrix mapping the vertices from the initial coordinate frame to the result is provided for you.  It is up to you to do all of the rest.\n\nA few notes:\n\n* You must use mipmapping on the texture for minification\n* When computing the vertex position in your shader use:\n\n```glsl\ngl_Position = camera * vec4(vertexPosition, 1);\n```\n\n* The format of the vertices of the cube is:\n\n```javascript\nposition_x, position_y, position_z, texture_s, texture_t\n```\n\n* The faces of the cube are given as triangles and stored in an array of element indices.",
