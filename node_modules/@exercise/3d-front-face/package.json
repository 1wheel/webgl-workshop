WebGL distinguishes between these two cases, labeling one of them (default counter clockwise) to the front face, and the other face as the back face.  This behavior can be changed using the `gl.FRONT_FACE` command:\n\n```javascript\ngl.frontFace(gl.CW)\n```\n\nThis command takes one of two arguments:\n\n* `gl.CW` for clockwise\n* `gl.CCW` for counter-clockwise",
