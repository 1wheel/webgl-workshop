webgl-workshop
==============

This is the sequel to shader-school.  The goal is to teach the basic WebGL API by breaking it down into manageable chunks.  Here is a sketch of how this could work:

1.  WebGL context creation
  1.  clear color
  1.  Viewport
  1.  Scissor
1.  Shaders
  1.  Shader objects (have student create vert/frag shaders)
  1.  Program objects (have student link shader)
  1.  Binding shaders
  1.  Uniforms
  1.  Constant attributes & attribute locations
1.  Buffers
  1.  Basic buffer creation
  1.  Attribute pointers
  1.  drawArrays
  1.  Element buffers and drawElements
1.  Advanced drawing
  1.  Line width
  1.  Face culling
  1.  Back face/front face variables
  1.  Polygon offset
  1.  Reading pixels
  1.  Depth buffer
  1.  Blending
  1.  Stencil buffer
1.  Textures
1.  Framebuffers
1.  Extensions
  1. Vertex array objects
  1. Float textures
  1. Instanced arrays
  1. Multiple draw buffers
  1.  Context loss
