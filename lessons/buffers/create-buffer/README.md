# Buffer objects

In this lesson, we are going to cover how to upload geometry to the GPU using WebGL.

## Exercise

Create a buffer object, and initialize it with an array of 6 floats:

```javascript
[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
```

To get started, modify the template for this lectures:

```javascript
module.exports = function(gl) {
  //Create an array buffer, initialize it with the prescribed data

  return null
}
```
