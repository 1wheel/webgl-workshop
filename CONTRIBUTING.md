# Contributing/Development

Requires [npm](http://npmjs.org/) `2.x.x` to work on locally due to the use
of local dependencies.

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:hughsk/workshop-app-shell.git
cd workshop-app-shell
npm install
npm start
```

## Publishing a New Version

The publish process for webgl-workshop is a little more involved. Before
publishing, we reinstall and dedupe all of the dependencies before creating
a tarball with all of the `node_modules` already included.

We then publish the **tarball** instead of the directory, meaning that the
installation can finish in a single step. This simplifies installing the
workshop when bandwidth is limited. So when publishing, *make sure to use
the following instead*:

``` bash
make publish
```

The `workshop.tar.gz` file that's generated can also be installed directly
if you have no internet access whatsoever:

``` bash
make pack
npm install ./workshop.tar.gz
```

## Running the Server

``` bash
npm run dev
```

## Building the App

``` bash
make clean build
```

## Writing a New Exercise

In this project, each exercise is treated as an *independent* package, i.e. a
directory with its own `package.json` file, dependencies and so on. You're also
given almost full control with your exercise â€“ it's essentially just a vanilla
route handler. See the [`exercises`](exercises) directory for a few existing
examples.

The steps are as follows:

1. Create a new directory in `exercises`. The name of this directory is not
   important.
1. Place a `package.json` file in there, with `main` pointing to `server.js` and
   the `name` being `@exercise/my-exercise-name`. This name will be used across
   the app to refer to the exercise in question (feel free to change that last
   part as you wish).
1. Copy `exercises/bare/server.js` into your new exercise directory.
1. Add an entry to `exercises.json`, where the key should be the exercise name
   as it appears on the menu and the value should be the same `name` property
   used in your `package.json`.
1. Run `npm install --save exercises/*` from the project root to update the
   exercise dependencies.

Next time you run the server you should be good to go!
