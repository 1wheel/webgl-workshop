The shader and data for the morph here have all been provided for you, but it is up to you to configure the vertex attribute pointers.\n\nSpecifically, there are two attributes here, which we will call `start` and `end` at locations `0` and `1` respectively.  Both of these attributes are of type `vec2` and stored in the buffer as floating point numbers.  That is, the memory for the buffer looks like this:\n\n```javascript\n[\n  startx0, starty0, endx0, endy0, // vertex 0\n  startx1, starty1, endx1, endy1, // vertex 1\n  startx2, starty2, endx2, endy2, // vertex 2\n  ...\n]\n```\n\nYou should set up attribute pointers for this buffer.\n\n# Info and hints\n\nRemember that `gl.vertexAttribPointer` can take in a stride and offset (both of which are given in bytes).\n",
