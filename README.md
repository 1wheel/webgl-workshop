# webgl-workshop

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/webgl-workshop.png?downloads=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/webgl-workshop/)

**Learn the basics of WebGL in small, manageable chunks. The sequel to
[shader-school](http://github.com/stackgl/shader-school), created for
[CampJS IV](http://campjs.com/) by
[Mikola Lysenko](http://github.com/mikolalysenko) and
[Hugh Kennedy](http://github.com/hughsk).**

## Running This Thing

First, you need to [get a browser with WebGL](http://get.webgl.org/), as well
as a copy of [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [git](http://git-scm.com/). Once you have
all of that set up, you can install the workshop using [npm](http://npmjs.org/), which
is included with node:

``` bash
sudo npm install -g webgl-workshop
```

After that completes, you should be able to run the workshopper with the command:

``` bash
webgl-workshop
```

The script will ask you if you want to create an answer directory, press `y` to
accept. This will populate your current directory with shader files for you to
edit for each lesson.

## Other Resources

There are also local copies of the following documentation available in the
[docs](docs/) directory in this repository.
