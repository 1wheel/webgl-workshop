This technique can be useful when combined with other methods, like depth prepass rendering to reduce the overhead of fragment shader computations.\n\nTo turn on/off rendering to the color buffer, you can use the `gl.colorMask` command:\n\n```javascript\ngl.colorMask(red, green, blue, alpha)\n```\n\nThis command accepts 4 boolean values, one for each of the color channels.  Setting a value to `false` turns off rendering for that color channel.  For example, to turn off alpha rendering you can do the following:\n\n```javascript\ngl.colorMask(true, true, true, false)\n```",
