# Exercise

Welcome to `webgl-workshop`! This exercise is just a warmup lesson to get you
familiar with how things work.

To pass this exercise, simply uncomment the line that draws the bunny to the
screen in your answer. If you're not sure how to do that yet, read on!

# Solutions

A working solution for each exercise will be running in the canvas at the
top-left of your screen – you should see a spinning bunny there now. Your
goal for each exercise is simply to ensure that your submission matches the
solution when both of them are rendered.

If you're *really* stuck on a lesson, you can click the face icon at the
top-right of the screen to view the code for the solution.

# Submissions

When you booted up the workshop, an "answers" directory should have been
created for you which contains a directory for each exercise.

To open up the current exercise's directory, click the edit icon up the top.
From there you can edit the files contained within to try and pass that lesson.
Generally you'll only need to edit **index.js** yourself – the rest of the files
are often helpers to help you avoid some of WebGL's infamous boilerplate.

# Passing a Lesson

Once you're happy with your submission, refresh the page and hit the green
button up the top to check your answer – if it's a match, you've passed and can
move onto the next lesson!
