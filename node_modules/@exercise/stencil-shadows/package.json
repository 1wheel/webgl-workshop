Specifically, you are provided with the following two methods:\n\n## `draw.mesh(t, intensity)`\nDraws a mesh at time t with light intensity proportional to the floating point number `intensity`\n\n## `draw.shadow(t)`\nDraws the shadow volume at time t\n\nWhat you should do for this exercise is render the regions of the mesh which do not intersect the shadow volume at intensity `1`, and the regions inside the shadow volume at intensity `0.1`.\n\n# Stencil shadows\n\nStencil shadows provide pixel perfect crisp shadows, and faithfully handle self occlusion and interaction between complex geometries.  The disadvantage is that they only support point and directional light sources (which means no area lights or soft shadows).\n\nStill, the effect is very pleasing relatively simple to implement.  The algorithm which we present here was discovered by John Carmack and implemented in the Doom 3 engine.  It has the advantage that it is very fast and robust to implement within hardware.\n\nAt a high level, the algorithm consists of the following steps:\n\n1.  Render the mesh fully lit into the color and depth buffer with no stencil test.\n2.  Turn off color and depth writes, then render the shadow volume into the buffer incrementing when back faces depth fail and decrementing when front faces depth pass.\n3.  Render the shadowed mesh over top of the existing mesh wherever the stencil buffer is not equal to 0.\n\nTo convince yourself that this works, it is helpful to draw a picture.\n",
