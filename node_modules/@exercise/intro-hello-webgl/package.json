This exercise is just a warmup lesson to get you\nfamiliar with how things work.\n\nTo pass this exercise, simply uncomment the line that draws the bunny to the\nscreen in your answer. If you're not sure how to do that yet, read on!\n\n# Solutions\n\nA working solution for each exercise will be running in the canvas at the\ntop-left of your screen – you should see a spinning bunny there now. Your\ngoal for each exercise is simply to ensure that your submission matches the\nsolution when both of them are rendered.\n\nIf you're *really* stuck on a lesson, you can click the face icon at the\ntop-right of the screen to view the code for the solution.\n\n# Submissions\n\nWhen you booted up the workshop, an \"answers\" directory should have been\ncreated for you which contains a directory for each exercise.\n\nTo open up the current exercise's directory, click the edit icon up the top.\nFrom there you can edit the files contained within to try and pass that lesson.\nGenerally you'll only need to edit **index.js** yourself – the rest of the files\nare often helpers to help you avoid some of WebGL's infamous boilerplate.\n\n# Passing a Lesson\n\nOnce you're happy with your submission, refresh the page and hit the green\nbutton up the top to check your answer – if it's a match, you've passed and can\nmove onto the next lesson!\n",
